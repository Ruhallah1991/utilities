<h1>Digital Logic Timing Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Timing analysis ensures that digital circuits operate reliably over all permissible conditions. It's vital in understanding the behavior of synchronous digital systems.
</p>

<h2>Setup Time (T<sub>setup</sub>)</h2>
<p>
The setup time is the minimum amount of time that the data signal should be stable before the clock edge arrives.
</p>
<p>
\[
T_{setup} \leq T_{clock} - T_{clk-q} - T_{comb}
\]
</p>

<h2>Hold Time (T<sub>hold</sub>)</h2>
<p>
Hold time is the minimum amount of time that the data signal needs to remain stable after the clock edge has occurred.
</p>
<p>
\[
T_{hold} \leq T_{clk-q} + T_{comb}
\]
</p>

<h2>Clock-to-Q Delay (T<sub>clk-q</sub>)</h2>
<p>
Clock-to-Q Delay is the time it takes for a flip-flop to propagate its input (D) to its output (Q) after a clock edge.
</p>

<h2>Combinational Delay (T<sub>comb</sub>)</h2>
<p>
Combinational Delay is the delay incurred by a combinational logic block in the circuit.
</p>

<h2>Contamination Delay (T<sub>cd</sub>)</h2>
<p>
Contamination Delay refers to the minimum time after the clock edge when the data output may begin to change.
</p>
<p>
\[
T_{hold} \leq T_{cd} + T_{comb}
\]
